INSTALL

Installation instructions for gladd.

(rather incomplete)

gladd_test (called by `make test`) requires a database to exist called gladd_test.  It is also essential that gladd_fake does *not* exist or the unit tests will fail.

== Ubuntu 12.04 LTS ==

apt-get install libxslt1.1
apt-get install libpq5
apt-get install libmysqlclient18
apt-get install libcurl3
