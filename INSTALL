INSTALL

Installation instructions for gladd.

The usual:
 ./configure
 make
 make install

will get things up and running.

There are a few options to configure:
 --with-openssl		Use OpenSSL for HTTPS (default is no https support)
 --with-gnutls		Use GnuTLS for HTTPS
 --without-mysql	Do not include support for mysql
 --without-postgres	Do not include support for postgresql
 --without-tds		Do not include support for tds databases
 			(sybase and SQL Server)
 --without-openldap	Do not include openldap support
 --without-xml		Disable xml and xslt support

Requires gladdb (available from https://github.com/brettsheffield/gladdb) for
database backend support to work.

== Tests ==

(rather incomplete)

gladd_test (called by `make test`) requires a database to exist called
gladd_test.  It is also essential that gladd_fake does *not* exist or the unit
tests will fail.
